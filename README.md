Stable Fluids in lua
=================

I needed a simple fluid solver written in lua for a game jam, so I converted the solver from 'Real-Time Fluid Dynamics for Games' by Jos Stam.

The original paper that I got it from is here:

Included in this repo is an example of how to use it in Love2D, just run love from the folder to try it out.
